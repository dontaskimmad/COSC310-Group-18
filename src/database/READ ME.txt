HOW TO CHANGE UPLOAD SIZE
*IMPORTANT*
go to xampp/php/php.ini

Alternatively when you open xampp you can click on configure in
apache and then select php.ini

max_execution_time: I had to set this to 15 minutes (900)
upload_max_filesize: This should be minimum 3mb
post_max_size: may need to be increased as well
memory_limit: Should be increased based on your computers specs
